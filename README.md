## üöß Latest Projects

### [MFinance](https://mfinance.me)

From the beginning of 2020, I got this personal project to help people to organize, manage and follow up their finances
in a very straightforward way. It was concluded in 3 months, the backend and the API layer is in Spring Boot (Java)
and frontend in ReactJS using Redux/Sagas.

The authentication is using AWS Cognito, the database is MySQL, the frontend is a simple dashboard that communicates 
with the API microservices built in ReactJS, using Redux as state management, Sagas for async state management, webpack for building, and the bundle
files are uploaded to a S3 bucket as a static website host configuration.

The backend it's reponsible for all the API calls, persistance on a MySQL database, database versioning, configuration 
management, and the security is done by Spring Security/Filters/JWT that receives the token from the frontend, and
process that using AWS SDK for Amazon.


The deployment of the backend are in EC2 instances, as docker containers, Nginx for reverse-proxy and 
SSL configuration.

Here is a screenshot of the project:

## Working with me

With the mentality of absorbing and learning everything from all the situations present in my life, mainly in the
 professional scope, I try to develop myself through work experiences to improve my technical knowledge.

Not only of technical attributes are made a professional, but the ability to communicate, teamwork and strategic planning are the key to achieving goals accurately. Thus, I believe that every person regardless of its level of knowledge has something to teach us, and that interpersonal relationships contribute to the development of countless sectors of our lives.

Therefore, I believe that having contact with people it's a primordial step for thrive in your
career, creating this network of helping and being helped by others, will create a clear path for you.

Working in a team, even that I know how to do my job, I try to talk with each other of the team, to check
if they really understand what the current project/task is about, and if I can help in some point.
